Welcome to Oryx Linux!
======================

This is the root directory of the Oryx Linux source tree. It is composed of
sub-repositories from both Oryx Linux itself and The Yocto Project.

Quickstart
----------

1) Follow the Yocto Project Quick Start guide (available from
   https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.7/brief-yoctoprojectqs/brief-yoctoprojectqs.html)
   to ensure that your system is capable of building images using The Yocto
   Project.

2) Build a minimal guest image for a supported platform such as a Raspberry Pi 3
   as follows:

        ./scripts/build.py -M raspberrypi3 -S guest -A minimal

3) Build a host image for the same platform as follows:

        ./scripts/build.py -M raspberrypi3 -S native -A host

4) Start a shell to run bitbake commands directly if needed, for example to
   build just the Linux kernel for a Raspberry Pi device, as follows:

        ./scripts/build.py -M raspberrypi3 --shell
        bitbake linux-raspberrypi
