Welcome to Oryx Linux!
======================

This is the root directory of the Oryx Linux source tree. It is composed of
sub-repositories from both Oryx Linux itself and The Yocto Project.

Quickstart
----------

1) Follow the Yocto Project Quick Start guide (available from
   https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.5.1/brief-yoctoprojectqs/brief-yoctoprojectqs.html)
   to ensure that your system is capable of building images using The Yocto
   Project.

2) Prepare the environment for an Oryx Linux build as follows:

    source build/conf/setenv

3) Build a minimal image for a supported platform such as a Raspberry Pi 3 as
   follows:

    ./scripts/run-build.py -M raspberrypi3

4) Run bitbake commands directly if needed, for example to build just the Linux
   kernel for a Raspberry Pi device, as follows:

    MACHINE=raspberrypi3 bitbake linux-raspberrypi
