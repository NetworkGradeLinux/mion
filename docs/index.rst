on the work of `The Yocto Project <https://www.yoctoproject.org/>`_ and
`OpenEmbedded <https://www.openembedded.org/>`_. It incorporates a
lightweight container runtime engine to bring the benefits of
containerization to the embedded sector without disrupting existing developer
workflows. For further details, see the :ref:`motivation` section of this
documentation.
